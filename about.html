                        The Euclidean Man proposes a surreal drift through a critical reflection on the human capacity to navigate technologically mediated environments. The narrative is guided by Marshall McLuhan's voice, who explores the acoustic nature of the electric world, through excerpts of his lectures and interviews, he comments on the effects of simultaneity and automation in our lives.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The audience is invited to a sensory experience, as the film starts with an action sequence that includes flashing color and violence and it is designed to create discomfort and induce a reflection on technology and empathy. At the end of this first short narrative segment, the tension disperses and a journey to the unconscious begins. The public is invited to reflect on how technology mediates our sensory experience.

                    <p>
                        Culture becomes a mirror of our automation, roles are subverted and strange transformations begin to manifest. The effects produced by our engagement with this enormous vortex of energy created by our media can manifest in patterns. The film, through voice, images, sound and symbols, is also constructed using patterns of timbre, rhythm, color and composition.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The result is an intense trip that hopes to serve as a beacon for exploration of both technology as culture and culture as technology. To reinforce this the end credits also play a surrealist trick to imagination by camouflaging as titles more references on the narrative subject of the film, to balance the predominant white male voice of 20th century academia, these excerpts are taken from inspiring female academics (Catherine Liu, Sherry Turkle, Ursula Franklin). The reason this is important is that the film is more than anything an invitation for the audience to start conversations and to be open to and inspired by the innate multiplicity of human experience.

                    <p>
                        Deeply influenced by DIY culture, through such diverse forces as surrealism, post punk and live coding, the narrative and the process developed in Euclidean Man are coherently framed in this background. In addition, most of the sound and image content and software to produce this film was developed by the artist or is openly available online. As in all the above-mentioned forms of expression, the artist is interested in using active imagination, not just during the creative process, but also to engage the public. He believes that imagination is crucial to elaborate not only media content but also to shift our understanding of the human experience towards a more context aware culture. Inspired among others by Ursula Franklin's concept of holistic systems of growth, as opposed to prescriptive systems of production.

                        William Friedkin used to comment that films inspire new films, in this case the director was inspired by multiple dimensions of the audiovisual experience. Euclidean Man was produced in a very particular way. Sound montage was, in principle, the driving narrative force, the film was drafted initially using voice, sound and music, then a conversation between image and sound started to happen. Many years ago, while in film school, Sebastian was fascinated to discover the work of Bill Morrison and learned more about his process, as well as the idea of using image and sound to reflect on history, to merge past and future by deconstructing what Chion calls the audiovisual contract. The decision to take this acoustic path was informed and reinforced by multiple factors, most importantly, it is core to the argument of the film, the idea of resonance and patterns, as manifestations of the possible. Therefore, the production process itself became the film, as it turned into a powerful hack to challenge an impersonal industrial process by using imagination and coherence as drivers.

                    <p>
                        One more element to take on board in this projection of artistic intention is the value of films like The Atomic Cafe (also Internet Archive footage), The Zone of Interest and Fairytale (these last screened in IFFR last year). In the case of these films, they resonate with the director's mission to create space for imagination through deconstruction and syncopation. This is manifested in his work, both in image and sound, by enabling and disabling sensory cues to the eye and the ear, by carefully crafting coherence and incoherence through the manipulation of symbols and cliches.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of his dreamy surrealist experiential art is to arouse the unconscious and allow the public to project themselves into his work, make it their own and start a conversation with the next person. The director's ultimate intention is to enable a communication forum that allows for both self expression and context awareness.

                            Live coding is a performing arts form and a creativity technique centered around writing computer code and algorithms in a live environment, typically with an audience watching the coding process. This form of creative expression blurs the boundaries between programming, music, and visual arts, allowing for real-time creation and manipulation of digital media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the context of this film, live coding serves as both subject matter and methodology, informing the glitched aesthetics and rhythmic editing patterns while also representing a philosophical approach to media creation that emphasizes process over product.
