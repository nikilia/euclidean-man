                            Sebastián Pappalardo (1976) has been working in the film industry since 2008, after returning from the Netherlands, where he was working in computer networks to Buenos Aires, where he started formally studying for his work in the media. His experiments with music and sound motivated him to change the world of computer servers for that of audio-visual post-production. Since 2008 he worked mostly in arthouse film sound post-production in Argentina and Chile, taking part in many award-winning films.

                            He also worked on advertisement, television, and interactive sound design. In 2019 he returned to Rotterdam after many years and continues to work on independent film post-production while also contributing to education at WdKA, as well as developing his multimedia art as eerie_ear. As part of this effort, he also produces regular open meetups for the Rotterdam creative coding community at V2.

                            At the center of his nomadic and eclectic life experience is a passion for audiovisual language and the relation between technology and culture, a subject with many dimensions that he continues to explore and share with the public.
